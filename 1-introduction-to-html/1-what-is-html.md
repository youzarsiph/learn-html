# What is HTML?

HTML is short for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage.
It's the skeleton of the Web, giving shape and structure to everything you see online. 🦴
HyperText means that you can click on words or pictures that take you to other web pages,
either on the same site or on different ones. It's like a treasure hunt of information that you can explore. 🔎
Markup means that you can use special symbols and tags to tell the Web browser how to display your content.
You can change the size, color, style, and position of your text, images, and other elements. It's like painting with code. 🖌️
