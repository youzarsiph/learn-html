# Whitespace in HTML

Whitespace is the **breathing room** between the words and symbols in your HTML code.
It can be one or more spaces, or even a **jump** to the next line.
Whitespace doesn't change how your content looks on the web page,
because the HTML parser **skips** it and shows only one space instead.
So why use whitespace at all? The answer is readability.
It can be **more fun** to read and edit your code if you have it well-organized and spaced out.

```htm
<p>I am learning HTML.</p>

<p>
  I
    am
      leaning
        HTML.
</p>
```

The result will be the same. ðŸ™Œ
