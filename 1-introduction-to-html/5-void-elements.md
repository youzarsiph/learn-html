# Void Elements

Some elements are *unique*, because they don't have a content or a closing tag.
Some elements have only one tag, which is usually used to *insert* something in the document.
Such elements are called void elements.

```htm
<img src="img/my-image.png" alt="Image description" />
```

This is an example of a void element. It has the name `img` inside the tag,
and some attributes that tell the Web browser where to find the image and what to show if the image is not there.
The tag ends with a slash, which means there is no content or closing tag. üñºÔ∏è
