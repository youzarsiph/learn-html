# Comments

HTML has a way to write comments in the code.
Browsers **ignore** comments, so they make comments **hidden** from the user.
The reason for comments is to let you write **clues** in the code to explain what you are doing or why.
This is very helpful if you **forget** some parts of your code after a long time and you need to **refresh** your memory.
Also, comments are very useful when different people are **collaborating** on the same code and need to understand each other.

To write an HTML comment, put it between the special symbols `<!--` and `-->`. For example:

```htm
<p>I'm not inside a comment</p>

<!-- <p>I am!</p> -->
```

This is how you can write comments in HTML without **changing** the content of your web page.
You can use comments to write **anything** you want, such as reminders, tips, questions, or jokes. ðŸ˜Š
