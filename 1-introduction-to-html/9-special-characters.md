# Special Characters

In HTML, the characters `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` and `&` are special characters.
They are like **keywords** that the HTML language uses to do its magic.
So how do you use one of these special characters in your text?
For example, if you want to write an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it mistaken for code.

You do this with character references.
These are like **secret codes** that represent characters, to be used in these situations.
Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&), and ends with a semicolon (;).

| Character | Character reference equivalent |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| <         | `&lt;`                         |
| >         | `&gt;`                         |
| "         | `&quot;`                       |
| '         | `&apos;`                       |
| &         | `&amp;`                        |

```htm
<p>In HTML, you create a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
```

This is how you can write special characters in HTML without confusing the Web browser. ðŸ¤“
You can use character references to write symbols, accents, emojis, and more. ðŸ˜Š
