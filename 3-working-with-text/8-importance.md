# Importance

Sometimes, we want to make some words stand out more than others in a sentence.
We do this to show that they are important or different in some way.
When we speak, we can do this by saying some words louder or softer, or with a different voice.
When we write, we can do this by making some words thicker or darker. This is called **importance**.
In HTML, which is the language we use to create web pages, we can use the `<strong>` (strong importance)
element to mark up the words we want to show as important.
This makes the document more helpful, and also helps the screen readers, which are tools that read the text aloud for people who can't see well.
Screen readers can change their voice when they read the important words.
Browsers, which are programs that show the web pages, make the important words look thicker by default.
You can also put strong and emphasis inside each other if you want.

```htm
<p>
  This liquid is 
  <strong>very dangerous</strong>
  â€” if you drink it, 
  <strong>you might <em>die</em></strong>.
</p>
```

This is how you can use importance in HTML using the `<strong>` element. Importance can make your content more expressive and clear. ðŸ˜Š
