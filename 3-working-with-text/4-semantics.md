# Semantics

Semantics are like **clues** that help us understand what things are and what they do.
We use our previous experience to recognize the semantics of everyday objects.
For example, we know that a chair is for sitting, a cup is for drinking, a book is for reading, and so on.
We need to make sure we are using the right objects for the right purposes, giving them the right meaning, function, or look.

In HTML, which is the language we use to create web pages, we also have semantics.
We have different **elements** that we can use to mark up our text, like `<h1>` for the main heading,
`<p>` for the paragraph, `<em>` for the emphasis, and so on.
These elements give the text they wrap around the meaning of "a main heading on your page", "a paragraph of text", "an important word or phrase", and so on.
By default, the browser will give them a different font size, style,
or color to make them look like what they mean. But you could make any element look like anything you want.

```htm
<!-- h1 element is a semantic element -->
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>

<!-- This is a <span> element. It has no semantics. -->
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block;">
  Is this a main heading?
</span>
```

This is how you can use semantics in HTML using the h1 element. Semantics can make your page more clear and meaningful. ðŸ˜Š
