# The basics

When you write a web page, you want to make your text look **nice** and **easy** to read.
You can do that by using **headings** and **paragraphs**.
Headings are like **titles** that tell you what the text is about.
Paragraphs are like **groups** of sentences that talk about the same thing.
You can find headings and paragraphs in many kinds of texts, like stories, newspapers, textbooks, magazines, and more.
They make the text more **organized** and more **fun** to read.

But how do you tell the browser that you want to use headings and paragraphs on your web page?
You use HTML, which is the language we use to create web pages.
HTML has different **elements** that you can use to mark up your text,
like `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for headings, and so on.
You have to put your text **inside** these elements, so the browser knows how to **show** them.
There are six kinds of heading elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`.
Each one shows a different **level** of content in the document.
`<h1>` shows the **main** heading, `<h2>` shows the **sub**headings, `<h3>` shows the **sub-sub**headings, and so on.

Here is an example of how to use the HTML elements for headings and paragraphs:

```htm
<h1>Headings are inside heading elements</h1>
<p>Paragraphs are inside p elements</p>
```
