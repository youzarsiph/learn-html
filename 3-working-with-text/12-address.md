# Address

When you create a web page, you might want to **share** your **contact details** with your visitors.
Maybe you want them to email you, call you, or follow you on social media.
How do you show them your contact details in a **nice** and **clear** way?

You can use a special element called `<address>` to **wrap around** your contact details.
This tells the computer and the people that this is your **contact information**.
It also makes your contact details look **neat** and **organized**.

Here is an example of how to use the `<address>` element:

```htm
<address>
  Page written by <a href="../authors/youzarsiph/">Youzarsiph</a>.
</address>
```
