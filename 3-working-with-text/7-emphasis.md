# Emphasis

Sometimes, we want to make some words stand out more than others in a sentence.
We do this to change the meaning of what we are saying, or to show how we feel about it.
When we speak, we can do this by saying some words louder or softer, or with a different voice.
When we write, we can do this by making some words slanted or tilted. This is called **emphasis**.
In HTML, which is the language we use to create web pages, we can use the `<em>` (emphasis) element to mark up the words we want to emphasize.
This makes the document more fun to read, and also helps the screen readers, which are tools that read the text aloud for people who can't see well.
Screen readers can change their voice when they read the emphasized words.
Browsers, which are programs that show the web pages, make the emphasized words look slanted by default.

```htm
<p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>
```

This is how you can use emphasis in HTML using the `<em>` element. Emphasis can make your content more expressive and clear. ðŸ˜Š
