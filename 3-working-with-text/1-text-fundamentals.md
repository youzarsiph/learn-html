# HTML text fundamentals

HTML is like a **secret code** that you can use to make your own web pages.
HTML tells the browser how to **arrange** the words and pictures on your web page, so that it looks **awesome** and **fun**.
HTML is made of different **elements** that you can use to mark up your text, like `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for headings, `<em>` for emphasis, and so on.
You can also use HTML to add **links**, **images**, **videos**, and other cool stuff to your web page. ðŸ˜Ž
