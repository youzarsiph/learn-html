# Implementing structural hierarchy

When you write a web page, you want to make your text look like a **tree**.
A tree has a **root**, which is the main part of the tree.
Then it has **branches**, which are smaller parts of the tree.
And then it has **leaves**, which are the smallest parts of the tree.
A tree is very **organized** and **beautiful**.

You can use HTML, which is the language we use to create web pages, to make your text look like a tree.
HTML has different **elements** that you can use to mark up your text, like `<h1>` for the root, `<h2>` for the branches, `<h3>` for the leaves, and so on.
You have to put your text **inside** these elements, so the browser knows how to **show** them.
There are six kinds of heading elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`.
Each one shows a different **level** of content in the document. `<h1>` shows the **main** part of the text, `<h2>` shows the **sub**parts of the text, `<h3>` shows the **sub-sub**parts of the text, and so on.

Here is an example of how to use the HTML elements to make your text look like a tree:
