# Superscript and Subscript

Sometimes, we need to write things that are **above** or **below** the normal line of text.
These are called **superscript** and **subscript**. For example, we use superscript to write the **ordinal numbers** like 1**st**, 2**nd**, 3**rd**, etc.
We use subscript to write the **chemical symbols** like: H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, etc.
We also use superscript and subscript to write some **math problems** like x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>, a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>3</sub>, etc.

But how do we tell the computer and other people that we want to use superscript and subscript?
We use two special elements called `<sup>` and `<sub>` to **wrap around** the text that we want to make superscript or subscript.
This way, the computer knows how to **display** the text, and the people know what it **means**.

Here is an example of how to use the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements:

```htm
<p>My birthday is on the 13<sup>th</sup> of April 2001.</p>er

<p>
  Caffeine's chemical formula is
  C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 16, x must equal 4 or -4.</p>
```
