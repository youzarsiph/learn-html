# Abbreviations

Sometimes, we use **short forms** of words or phrases to save time and space.
These are called **abbreviations** or **acronyms**. For example, **HTML** is an abbreviation for **Hypertext Markup Language**.
HTML is the language we use to create web pages like this one.

But how do we tell the computer and other people what these abbreviations mean? We use a special element called `<abbr>` to **wrap around** the abbreviation.
We also need to **explain** the abbreviation in **plain text** the first time we use it.
This way, the computer knows how to **pronounce** the abbreviation, and the people know what it **stands for**.

Here is an example of how to use the `<abbr>` element:

```htm
<p>
  We use <abbr>HTML</abbr>, Hypertext Markup Language, to structure our web
  documents.
</p>
```

I hope this rewrite is more creative, beginner friendly, enjoyable and friendly. ðŸ˜Š
