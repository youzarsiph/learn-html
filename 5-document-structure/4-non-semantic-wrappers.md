# Non Semantic Layout Elements

Sometimes you'll *encounter* a situation where you can't find a *perfect* semantic
element to *combine* some items together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want
to just *bundle* a set of elements together to *change* them all as a single entity with some CSS or JavaScript.

HTML provides the `<div>` and `<span>` elements. You should use these *with* a suitable class attribute,
to give some kind of *name* for them so they can be *found* easily.
