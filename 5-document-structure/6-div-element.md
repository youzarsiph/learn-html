# `<div>` Element

`<div>` is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't
find a *more suitable* semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning.

```htm
<div class="shopping-cart">
  <h2>**My cart** 🛒</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="/cart">
          <strong>*Apples*</strong> 🍎: $9.99.
        </a>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

This is how you can use the `<div>` element in HTML to wrap your content without adding any meaning.
The `<div>` element can help you *organize* your web page better. 😊
