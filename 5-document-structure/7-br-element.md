# How to use `<br>` 📝

Sometimes, you might want to create a **line break** in your text, which means starting a new line without ending the paragraph.
For example, if you are writing a **postal address** or a **poem**, you might want to keep the lines short and separate. 💌

To do this, you can use the `<br>` element in your HTML code. This element is **self-closing**,
which means it does not need a closing tag. It just tells the browser to move to the next line. 🙌

Here is an example of how to use `<br>` in a poem:

```htm
<p>
  Roses are red, <br />
  Violets are blue, <br />
  HTML is fun, <br />
  And so are you! 😊
</p>
```
