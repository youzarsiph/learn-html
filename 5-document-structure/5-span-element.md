# `<span>` Element

`<span>` is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't find a
*more suitable* semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning.

```htm
<p>
  HTML is used for *organizing* pages only.
  <span class="note">
    **Note**: CSS is used for *designing*.
    JS is used for *making things fun*.
  </span>
</p>
```

This is how you can use the `<span>` element in HTML to wrap your content without adding any meaning.
