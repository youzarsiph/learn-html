# How to use `<hr>` 🌟

Sometimes, you might want to show a **thematic break** in your text, which means a change of subject or mood.
For example, if you are writing a **story**, you might want to separate different scenes or chapters. 📚

To do this, you can use the `<hr>` element in your HTML code.
This element is **self-closing**, which means it does not need a closing tag.
It just draws a horizontal line across the page. 📏

Here is an example of how to use `<hr>` in a story:

```htm
<p>
  Alice was curious about the rabbit hole. She decided to follow the white rabbit and see where it led...
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  Alice found herself in a strange land full of wonders.
  She saw a caterpillar smoking a hookah, a grinning cat that could disappear,
  and a mad hatter having a tea party...
</p>
```
