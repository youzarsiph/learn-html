# HTML for Structuring Content

In your HTML code, you can *organize* sections of content based on their functionality.
HTML provides *special* tags that you can use to show the sections.

- header: Can be shown by `<header>` element.
- navigation bar: Can be shown by `<nav>`.
- main content: `<main>`, with various content subsections shown by `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<div>` elements.
- sidebar: `<aside>`; often placed inside `<main>`.
- footer: `<footer>`.

This is how you can use HTML for structuring content using the `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<div>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` elements.
HTML for structuring content can make your web page more *neat* and *clear*. ðŸ˜Š
