# Document Structure

HTML provides a number of block level elements used to *divide* your website
into different parts, such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column".

Webpages can and will look *very* different from one another, but they all tend to have some common parts:

- Header: Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and maybe a tagline.
  This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
- navigation bar: Links to the site's main sections; usually shown by menu buttons, links, or tabs.
  Like the header, this content usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
- Main content: A big area in the center that has most of the *special* content of a given webpage.
  This is the one part of the website that *surely* will change from page to page!
- Sidebar: Usually, this is *related* to what is in the main content.
- Footer: A strip across the bottom of the page that usually has small print,
  *credits*, or contact info.

This is how you can use document structure in HTML using block level elements.
Document structure can make your web page more *organized* and *clear*. ðŸ˜Š
