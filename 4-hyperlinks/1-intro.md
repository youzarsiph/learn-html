# Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are one of the most *amazing* innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the *start*, and are what makes the Web a web.
Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to *specific* parts of documents, or make apps *accessible* at a web address.

## Link Anatomy

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an `<a>` element and using the href attribute, also known as a *Hypertext Reference*, or target, that contains the web address.

```htm
<p>
  My Github
  <a href="https://github.com/youzarsiph"
    title="Using title attribute you can add *extra* info, 
    such as which kind of information the page contains">
    **portfolio**
  </a>.

```
