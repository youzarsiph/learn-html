# Absolute vs Relative URLs

Two terms you'll *encounter* on the Web are absolute URL and relative URL.

## Absolute URL

Points to a location defined by its *exact* location on the web, including protocol and domain name.
An absolute URL will always point to the same location, no matter where it's used.

```htm
<p>
  Here is an absolute <a href="https://www.example.com/">**URL**</a>.
</p>
```

## Relative URL

Points to a location that is *related* to the file you are linking from
A relative URL will point to different places depending on the *actual* location of the file you refer from.

```htm
<p>
  Here is a relative <a href="../projects/index.html">*URL*</a>.
</p>
```

This is how you can use absolute and relative URLs in HTML using the `<a>` element.
URLs can help you *connect* your web pages and resources. ðŸ˜Š
