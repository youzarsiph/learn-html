# Link Best Practices

There are some *tips* to follow when writing links.

- Use *clear* link text.
- Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text â€” URLs look *messy*, and sound even *worse* when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
- Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text.
- Keep your link text as *brief* as possible â€” this is helpful because screen readers need to *understand* the entire link text.
- *Avoid* instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places

<h1>Link Examples</h1>

<h2>Good Link Text</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/youzarsiph">**View My Portfolio**</a>
</p>

<h2>Bad Link Text</h2>
<p>
  Click <a href="https://github.com/youzarsiph">*here*</a> to view my portfolio.
</p>

```

This is how you can use link best practices in HTML using the `<a>` element.
Link best practices can make your links more *user-friendly* and *accessible*. ðŸ˜Š
