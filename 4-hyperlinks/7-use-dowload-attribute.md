# Use `download` Attribute

When you are linking to a resource that's to be *saved* rather than opened in the browser,
you can use the download attribute to give a *suggested* save filename.

```htm
<a
  href="https://download.example.com/my-resume.pdf"
  download="my-resume.pdf">
  **Download** My Resume
</a>
```

This is how you can use the download attribute in HTML using the `<a>` element.
The download attribute can make your links more *user-friendly* and *convenient*. ðŸ˜Š
