# Metadata

Metadata is like a *hidden note* that tells more about your web page,
and HTML has a *smart way* to hide metadata in your document â€” the `<meta>` element.

```htm
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Write your name here so everyone knows who created this amazing page -->
    <meta name="author" content="Your name" />
    <!-- Write a catchy summary of your page here so people will want to check it out -->
    <meta name="description" content="Your page summary" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Metadata in HTML</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

This is how you can *slip* metadata into your HTML using the `<meta>` element.
Metadata can have things like your name, your page summary, your page size, and more.
Metadata helps the Web browser and the search engines *discover* and *show* your page better. ðŸ˜Ž
