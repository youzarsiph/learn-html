# What is head?

When you write a web page, you might want to add some information that is *secret* to the people who visit your page.
For example, you might want to give your page a *name*, make it look *fancy* with CSS,
add a *tiny* icon that shows up in the browser tab, and tell the browser some *facts* about your page,
like who made it and what it is about. This information goes in the head of your HTML document,
which is the part that is *invisible* to the web browser when the page is loaded.
You can use different elements to *decorate* the information in the head, like `<title>` for the page *name*,
`<link>` for the CSS and favicon *links*, and `<meta>` for the *facts*.
The browser uses the information in the head to show the HTML document *properly*.
