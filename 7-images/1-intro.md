# Make your web pages pop with multimedia 🎨

Text is great, but it's not enough to make your web pages awesome.
You need some **visuals** and **sounds** to spice things up! 🌶️ In this module,
you'll learn how to use HTML to add different kinds of multimedia to your web pages,
such as images, videos, audios, and even other web pages.
You'll also learn how to embed them in different ways, so you can control how they look and behave. 🙌
