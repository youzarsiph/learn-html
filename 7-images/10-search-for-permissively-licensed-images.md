# Search for permissively-licensed images 📸

Need some cool images for your projects that are free and legal to use? 😎
You can find them using an **image search engine** or an **image repository**.

To find the images you want, use keywords that describe the image and the license you want.
For example, if you want a picture of a blue sky ☁️, you can type "blue sky" and "public domain images" or "creative commons images".

Some search engines have tools that help you filter the images by license.
For example, on Google, you can go to the "Images" tab, click on "Tools", and select "Usage Rights".

Some websites only have images that you can use freely, such as Picryl or The Noun Project.
Other websites, like Flickr or Pixabay, have options to search by license.

When you find the image you like, check the license details and follow the instructions.
For example, some licenses may ask you to give credit to the creator.
You can usually find the license details on the same page where you download the image.
