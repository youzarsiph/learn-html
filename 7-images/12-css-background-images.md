# CSS Background Images

Did you know that you can use CSS to put images on your webpages? (You can also use JavaScript, but that's a different story ðŸ˜œ).
The CSS background-image property, and the other background-* properties, let you control where and how the images appear.
For example, if you want to have a sky image on every paragraph on your page, you can do this:

```css
p {
  background-image: url("images/sky.jpg");
}
```

This way, you can easily move and adjust the images with CSS. So why use HTML images at all? Well, CSS images are only for decoration.
They are like stickers that you put on your page to make it look nice. ðŸŒŸ But they don't have any meaning or purpose.
They can't have any text to describe them, and they can't be seen by screen readers that help people who can't see the images.
This is where HTML images come in handy!

To sum up: if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an HTML image.
If an image is just for decoration, you should use CSS images. ðŸ™Œ
