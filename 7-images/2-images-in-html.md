# Make your web pages more fun with images 📷

Do you remember when the Web was just a bunch of boring text? 😴 Well, not anymore!
Thanks to the power of HTML, you can now add images (and other cool stuff) to your web pages and make them more lively and attractive. 🎉

The easiest way to add an image to your web page is to use the `<img>` element.
This element lets you specify the source, size, and alternative text of your image.
But that's not all! You can also use the `<figure>` element to add captions to your images and explain what they are about. 🙌

But wait, there's more! You can also use CSS to set background images for your web page or any element on it.
This way, you can create stunning effects and layouts with your images. 🌟

And if you think that's all, you're wrong! There are many other types of graphics that you can use on the web,such as SVG, Canvas, and WebGL.
These graphics allow you to create vector drawings, animations, and 3D scenes on your web page. 😍
