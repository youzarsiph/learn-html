# Understanding License Types 📄

When you find an image on the web, you need to check its license. This tells you how you can use it legally.
There are different types of licenses, but here are some common ones:

## All rights reserved

This means that the owner has all the rights to use the image.
You can't use it without their permission. You have to ask, pay, or follow the law to use it.

## Permissive

This means that the owner lets you use the image for free, but with some rules.
You have to credit, share, or include the license to use it.

## Copyleft

This is a special type of license for software.
It means that if you use the code to make a new project, you have to use the same license for it.

## Public domain/CC0

This means that the work has no rights reserved.
Anyone can use it without permission and without any conditions. The work is free for everyone. 🎁

When you use public domain images, get proof that the image is public domain and keep it safe. 📸
