# Add Images üñºÔ∏è

If you want to add a simple image to your web page, you need to use the `<img>` element.
This element is special because it doesn't have any content inside it or an end tag.
It just needs two things to work: src and alt. The src attribute tells the web browser where to find the image you want to show on your page.
You can use a relative URL or an absolute URL for this. The alt attribute tells the web browser what to show if the image cannot be loaded.
This is important for accessibility and SEO. Without a src attribute, the `<img>` element won't show anything on your page. üò¢

```htm
<img src="sky.png" alt="The Sky" />
```
