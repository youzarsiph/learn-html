# How to use images and other media legally 📜

Images (and other things like videos, music, or fonts) that you see on the web belong to someone.
They have different rules for how you can use them. Before you put an image on your own website,
make sure you have the right to do so. You can either create the image yourself,
ask the owner for permission, or follow the owner's terms and conditions. 🙏
