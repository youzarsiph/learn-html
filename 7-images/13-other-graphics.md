# Other Graphics on The Web ðŸŽ¨

You already know how to use the `<img>` element, or the background-image property, to show static images on your webpages.
But did you know that you can also create and change graphics with code? ðŸ˜² The browser lets you do amazing things with 2D and 3D graphics, as well as video from files or live cameras:

- Canvas
  The `<canvas>` element lets you draw 2D graphics with JavaScript.
  You can make shapes, colors, animations, and more. ðŸ™Œ

- SVG
  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) lets you use lines, curves, and other geometric shapes to make 2D graphics.
  The best thing about vectors is that they don't lose quality when you resize them. ðŸŒŸ

- WebGL
  WebGL, the 3D graphics API for the Web.
  With WebGL, you can use standard OpenGL ES to create stunning 3D scenes and games. ðŸŽ®

- Using HTML audio and video
  Just like `<img>`, you can use HTML to add `<video>` and `<audio>` to your web page and control how they play.
  You can make your webpages more interactive and engaging with sound and motion. ðŸŽµ

- WebRTC
  The RTC in WebRTC stands for Real-Time Communications,
  a technology that lets you stream audio/video and share data between browser clients (peers).
  You can use WebRTC to make video calls, chat rooms, and more. ðŸ“ž
