# Debugging HTML

Writing HTML is fun, but sometimes things can go wrong, and you don't know why your code is not working. 😕
When you write code, everything is usually fine, until you see an error message — you made a mistake,
so your code doesn't do what you want it to do — or it doesn't do anything at all. 😱
But don't panic — debugging is not as scary as it sounds. 🙅‍♂️ The secret to being confident with writing and fixing any code is to know the language and the tools well. 🙌

HTML is not very hard to learn compared to Rust.
HTML is not changed into a different form before the browser shows it on the screen(it is interpreted, not compiled).
And HTML's element syntax is much simpler than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python.
The way that browsers read HTML is more forgiving than how programming languages are run,
which can be good or bad depending on the situation. 🤷‍♀️
