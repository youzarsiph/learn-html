# HTML Validation

In a small example, it is easy to spot the mistakes and fix them,
but what if you have a big, complicated HTML document? ðŸ¤¯

The best way to start is by using the **Markup Validation Service** â€” a tool made and updated by the W3C,
the group that makes the rules for HTML, CSS, and other web stuff.
This webpage lets you enter an HTML document and checks it for you, and tells you what you need to fix in your HTML. ðŸ™Œ
