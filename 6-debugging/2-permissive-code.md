# Permissive Code

Permissive means that something is not very strict or picky.
🙃 When you write code, you might make some mistakes that cause two kinds of errors:

- Syntax errors: These are like typos or grammar mistakes in your code that stop the program from running, like the Rust error you see above.
  These are usually easy to fix if you know the rules of the language and what the error messages mean. 🛠
- Logic errors: These are errors where the code looks fine, but it does something different from what you wanted,meaning that the program runs wrong.
  These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, because there is no error message to help you find the problem. 😓

HTML is different from other languages because it doesn't have syntax errors. Browsers read HTML permissively, meaning that the page still shows up even if there are syntax errors. Browsers have their own ways to deal with badly written markup, so you'll get something on the screen, even if it is not what you expected. This can be good or bad, depending on the situation. 🤔

HTML is permissive because when the web was first born, it was more important to let people share their content than to make sure the syntax was perfect. The web might not be as awesome as it is today, if it had been more rigid from the start. 🌐
