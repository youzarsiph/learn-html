# The `<track>` Element

Let's talk about a cool feature that you might want to learn.
Many people can't or don't like to listen to the audio/video content they see on the Web, for different reasons.

For example:

- Some people have hearing problems (like being hard of hearing or deaf)
  so they can't hear the audio well or at all.
- Some people can't hear the audio because they are in loud places
  (like a busy bar when a sports game is on).
- Some people don't want to hear the audio because it would bother them or others
  (like in a library or when someone is sleeping), so captions can help them.
- Some people don't understand the language of the video, so they might need a
  text transcript or a translation to follow the media content.

It would be nice to give these people a way to read the words that are spoken in the audio/video, right?
Well, with HTML video, you can. You just need to use the WebVTT file format and the `<track>` element. ðŸ™Œ
